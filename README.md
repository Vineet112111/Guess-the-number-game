## 🧠 About the Game

The game randomly selects a number between 1 to 100. You have to guess it with hints like:

- “You’re just above the number”
- “You’re just below the number”

It calculates **accuracy** based on how many incorrect guesses you made, and gives you a final score when you guess correctly!

## 🎨 Background Story (from the developer)

> “While working on the `style.css`, I spent nearly **2 hours** just playing with `background-size`, `background-position`, and gradients.  
> I didn’t even realize how time flew — and suddenly, something visually beautiful just happened!  
> That magical feeling of creativity made this project **really special** for me. 😄”
